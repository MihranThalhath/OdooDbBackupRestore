# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com) Backup & Restore Scripts (Beta)

DISCLAIMER: These scripts were created when I was still learning about Odoo. There are better alternatives which can be used
to do the same. Also please make sure you are not doing anything in the production environment before doing a round of testing.

* These scripts can be used to take database backups & to restore these backed up databases.
* The database backup script can be used in a cronjob to take regular backups. 
* These scripts are useful if the database sizes are huge.
